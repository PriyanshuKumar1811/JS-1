Modules in JavaScript
---------------------

    --> Simply a file containing code that can be reused in other files.

    Why?
    ----

        --> Organized Code: Split large programs into smaller files.
        --> Reusability: Write a function once and reuse it anywhere.
        --> Maintainability: Easier to debug and update because each module focuses on a 
            specific functionability.
