    Why Type Conversion is Important
    --------------------------------

        When taking data from an input field, it is usually in the form of a string, 
        even if the user enters a number. To perform numeric operations, you need to convert these strings to 
        numbers.


    Installing Necessary Packages
    -----------------------------

        Before we dive into the code, we need to set up our environment. 
        Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), 
        which we will use to install packages.

        1. Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.
        2. Install readline-sync Package: This package allows us to read user input from the terminal.

        Open your terminal and run the following command to install readline-sync:

            npm install readline-sync / npm i readline-sync


    Getting User Input
    ------------------

        1. Set Up readline-sync:

            const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

        2. Ask for User Input:

            const userName = readlineSync.question('May I know your name ');
            console.log(userName);

            const userAge = readlineSync.question('May I know your age ');
            const userAgeNumber = Number(userAge);

        Converting String to Number: The Number() function converts the string input to a number. 
        If the input is not a valid number, it returns NaN (Not-a-Number).

    
    Running the Code
    ----------------

        To run this code, open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your script, and use the 
        following command:

        node your-script-file.js / node your-script-file

        Replace your-script-file.js with the name of your JavaScript file.


    Key Points:
    -----------

        1. Type Conversion: Converting data from one type to another is essential for performing various operations.
        2. User Input: Using readline-sync to read user input from the terminal.
