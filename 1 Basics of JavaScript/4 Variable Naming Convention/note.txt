    Rules for Naming Variables
    --------------------------

        1. Characters Allowed: A variable name can consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, 
        the dollar sign ($), and the underscore (_).
        2. No Leading Numbers: A variable name cannot start with a number but can end with number.
        3. No Special Characters: Avoid special characters such as @, #, -, or brackets.
        4. Case Sensitivity: Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.
