Execution Context in Javascript
-------------------------------

    Introduction
    ------------

        Execution context is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that dictates how the code is executed.
    

    Browser and JavaScript Engine
    -----------------------------

        When a browser encounters JavaScript code, it activates the JavaScript engine. 
        Each browser has its own JavaScript engine (ex- V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).

        Execution Context in Javascript:    Browser -> JavaScript Engine


    Execution Context
    -----------------

        The JavaScript engine creates an environment called the execution context to execute the code. 
        This environment manages the memory allocation and the execution of the code.


    Types of Execution Context
    --------------------------

        1.  Global Execution Context (GEC):     Created when the JavaScript engine starts executing the code. 
                                                There is only one GEC per JavaScript file.

        2.  Functional Execution Context (FEC):     Created whenever a function is invoked. 
                                                    There can be multiple FECs depending on the number of function calls.

    
    Components of Execution Context:
    --------------------------------

        1. Variable Object: Contains variable and function declarations.
        2. Scope Chain: Manages the scope and scope chain.
        3. this Keyword: Sets the value of this.


    Creation of Execution Context
    -----------------------------

        Execution context is created in two phases:

            1. Creation Phase:
            ------------------

                Memory allocation for variables and functions.
                Variables declared with var are assigned undefined.
                Function declarations are assigned the function definition.

            2. Execution Phase:
            -------------------

                Code is executed line by line.
                JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous language, meaning it executes one line of code at a 
                time in order.


    Importance of Understanding Execution Context
    ---------------------------------------------

        Understanding execution context is crucial for several reasons:

        1. Code Execution: It helps in understanding how JavaScript executes code line by line.
        2. Debugging: It aids in debugging by showing the sequence of function calls.
        3. Memory Management: It helps in understanding how memory is allocated and deallocated.
