JavaScript Nullish Coalescing
-----------------------------

    --> In JavaScript, nullish coalescing is a new type of logical operator that was introduced to help simplify 
        handling undefined and null values. This operator can help prevent pitfalls that might occur when working 
        with values like undefined, null, 0, or an empty string.

    --> The nullish coalescing operator (??) is used to assign a default value to a variable when the value is 
        either null or undefined. This is particularly useful when you want to provide a fallback value only for 
        null or undefined, but you want to keep values like 0 or an empty string ("") intact.

    --> The syntax for the nullish coalescing operator is:

            let result = value ?? defaultValue;

            If value is neither null nor undefined, it will return value.
            If value is null or undefined, it will return defaultValue.
