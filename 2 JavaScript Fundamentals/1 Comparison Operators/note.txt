JavaScript Comparison Operators
-------------------------------

    --> In JavaScript, strings are compared based on their ASCII (Unicode) values.
    --> When comparing two strings, JavaScript checks their characters from left to right, comparing the ASCII 
        values of each character.
    --> This comparison is case-sensitive, meaning uppercase letters have a lower ASCII value than lowercase 
        letters, which affects string comparisons.

    --> Loose Equality (==): Converts the values before comparing them.
    --> Strict Equality (===): Checks both the value and the type.

    --> The strict equality operator (===) does not perform type conversion.

    --> null has unique behavior when used in mathematical comparisons (such as <, >, <=, >=). 
        In these comparisons, null is treated as 0.

    --> JavaScript automatically converts strings to numbers in numerical comparisons.
    --> Undefined always results in false in numerical comparisons.
