Introduction To BOM
-------------------

    What is DOM (Document Object Model)?
    ------------------------------------

        These models are essential for interacting with web pages.

        DOM, or Document Object Model, represents the structure of a web page in a tree-like structure, 
        where each element is a node. It is used to represent the content of a webpage, and it allows 
        you to access, modify, or manipulate that content. With DOM, you can:

        1. Modify the HTML structure of the webpage.
        2. Change styles and appearance.
        3. Add or remove HTML elements dynamically.

    
    What is BOM (Browser Object Model)?
    -----------------------------------

        BOM stands for Browser Object Model, and it represents the browser's environment. 
        BOM provides the necessary tools to interact with various browser features and functionalities, 
        such as browser information, location, history, and more. It helps you interact with the browser 
        itself, not just the web page content.

    
    Why do we need BOM?
    -------------------

        BOM allows us to access important information about the browser, and manipulate the browser window 
        and navigation. For example, you can:

        1. Find out which browser the user is using.
        2. Redirect users to specific pages.
        3. Access the browser’s history or location.


    Some Key Objects in BOM:
    ------------------------

        1. Window Object: Represents the browser window. It provides methods like alert(), open(), close(), etc., to interact with the window.
        2. Navigator Object: Provides information about the browser, such as its version and name.
        3. Screen Object: Gives information about the screen size and resolution.
        4. History Object: Allows you to interact with the browser’s history, like navigating back or forward.
        5. Location Object: Used for accessing and manipulating the URL of the browser window.

        These objects have various properties and methods that you can use to make decisions or control 
        how the browser behaves.
